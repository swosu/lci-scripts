## SSH keys for passwordless SSH

# As root on login node
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
chmod 700 /root/.ssh
touch /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# As root on each compute node/storage node
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
chmod 700 /root/.ssh

# As root on the login node
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
scp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys lci-compute-XX-1:/root/.ssh
scp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys lci-compute-XX-2:/root/.ssh
scp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys lci-storage-XX-1:/root/.ssh

## Parallel Shell (first thing that actually needed to be done)
dnf install clustershell

# Add the following to the /etc/clustershell/groups.d/local.cfg file (replace the example stuff)
head: lci-head-XX-1
compute: lci-compute-XX-[1-2]
login: lci-head-XX-1
storage: lci-storage-XX-1

# Test it out
clush -g compute "uptime"

## Time Sync
dnf install chronyd
#confirm config file meets expectation
systemctl start chronyd && systemctl enable chronyd

# Creatre morest users
useradd -u 2002 justin
useradd -u 2003 katie

## Central Logging

# Remove comments for following lines in /etc/rsyslog.conf on lci-head-XX-1
$ModLoad imudp.so
$UDPServerRun 514
$ModLoad imtcp.so
$InputTCPServerRun 514

# Add these two lines in the Modules section:
$template DynamicFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/forwarded-logs.log"
*.* -?DynamicFile

# Restart rsyslog on head node
systemctl restart rsyslog

# Add following to the very bottom of /etc/rsyslog on both compute nodes/storage node and restart rsyslog service on those nodes
*.* @lci-head-XX-1
systemctl restart rsyslog

# After a few minutes you should see new log directories in /var/log/ on lci-head-XX-1, a directory for each host forarding logs
ls /var/log/messaegs/lci-[computes/storage]-XX-Y/
